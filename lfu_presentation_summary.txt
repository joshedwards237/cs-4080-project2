LFU CACHE PERFORMANCE WITH UNIFORM RANDOM ACCESS DISTRIBUTION
==========================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
- Tested 24 configurations of cache and alphabet sizes
- Average hit rate across all tests: 0.2647
- Theoretical model correlation: 1.0000
- Best performing cache size: 100

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Hit rate is directly proportional to the cache-to-alphabet ratio
2. Empirical results match theoretical predictions for uniform distribution
3. Average deviation from theoretical model: 0.0005
4. LFU performance is similar to LRU for uniform distribution

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. For uniform access patterns, cache size should be at least 10% of alphabet size
2. Cache-to-alphabet ratio is the primary determinant of hit rate
3. LFU may have higher overhead than LRU but similar hit rates for uniform distribution
