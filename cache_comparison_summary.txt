LRU VS LFU CACHE PERFORMANCE WITH UNIFORM RANDOM ACCESS
=======================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
- Tested 32 configurations for both LRU and LFU caches
- LRU Average hit rate: 0.3912
- LFU Average hit rate: 0.3911
- LRU-Theoretical correlation: 0.9997
- LFU-Theoretical correlation: 0.9997

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Both LRU and LFU hit rates closely match theoretical predictions for uniform distribution
2. LFU runtime is 221.0% higher than LRU
3. LFU memory usage is 62.5% higher than LRU
4. For uniform random access, both algorithms have similar hit rates

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. For uniform access distributions, LRU is generally preferable due to lower overhead
2. Cache-to-alphabet ratio is the primary determinant of hit rate for both algorithms
3. LFU may be more beneficial for non-uniform distributions with frequently recurring items
